In a technology venture, the role of technology is vital. As an engineer, I’ve often wondered how anything else can be more important.

But it takes ***a lot more*** than technology to build a product. And a lot more than a product to build a business.

Technology may indeed be the engine of your car. And a car surely is useless without the engine. But nobody ever just bought an engine because it could move things.

You needed chassis, wheels, seats, interiors and a hundred other things. 
**That’s product**. But nobody ever bought a car just because you had one ready.

You had to figure out service centers, dealerships, pricing, capital, marketing and a thousand other things. 
**That’s business**.

If you ever decide to build something, try to think about these things. You don’t need to define them on day one. Hell, you won’t even be able to.

But you will need ***all*** of them, eventually.
