**Knowledge** is a set of *points* in our mental space. Then we make *connections* among them.

> What do we get? **A Graph**.

As we receive information and apply thought, we build denser graphs. Lots of points and lots of connections.

Points and the connections don't stay forever. They fade if not revisited. That's **memory**.

For most people, the graphs are clustered around their field or discipline. So what's **reasoning**?Reasoning is the act of graph traversal. 

### Types of people by their graphs

*Intelligent* people can do fast graph traversal.
*Curious* people keep seeking new points on the graph.
*Creative* people make unobvious connections.
*Stupid* people fail to make even the obvious connections.

*Ignorant* have very sparse graphs.
*Experts* have atleast one very dense cluster.
*Polymaths* have multiple dense and dissimilar clusters.
