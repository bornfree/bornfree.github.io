Why are shower thoughts a thing?

Why are shower thoughts a *thing*?

That was my last shower thought. I think I get a lot of interesting ideas while showering. Most people do. About work, travel, hobbies, start-ups etc.
*Interesting* thoughts. Not necessarily *useful*.

But why is it so? Physical isolation combined with indolence is probably very powerful. Even if it is only for 10 minutes.

When we block out other people not by intention but simply by design (you don’t want to naked in-front them I’m assuming), we put our mind into an amazing zone with low inhibitions.

***We let it roam free!***

Then I’m curious to know how to create more of such environments. Where people can forget the world around them and *think*. 
*Just think.*
