It is said that the line

> To be, or not to be

by Shakespeare is one of the [most quoted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_be,_or_not_to_be) lines in English language.

Written in binary, it would simply be

> 1, or 0

which Shannon [postulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication) that all information can be encoded as.

Now this might be a pure coincidence. 
But why should I not indulge in the fantastic speculation that Shakespeare and Shannon, both masters of completely different worlds, were thinking on the same lines?!
