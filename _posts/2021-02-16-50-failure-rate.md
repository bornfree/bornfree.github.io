That's the rate at which my travels fail.

Before *everybody *became a traveler, I was considered a decent one. Not that I spent a lot of time visting exotic or fancy destinations. Just that I would be off on a bus or a train the moment I had 2 holidays in a row.

For all the excessive wandering, I ended up at rather boring, meaningless places half of the time. 

I ended up at certain waterfalls, 30 years after it dried up.
On a random mountain because it was the highest in vicinity etc etc.

But for some reason, I was never really disheartened. Even when others in the group were. That's the price to pay to find places that are really rare.
