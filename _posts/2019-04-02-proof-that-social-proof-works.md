Too often we aren’t convinced about facts until we experience them firsthand. Kind-of unfortunate but true.

Too often we aren’t convinced about facts until we experience them firsthand. Kind-of unfortunate but true.

Here’s a recent incident that gave me a *live demo* of

> ***People try something new if they know other people are also trying it****. Aka social proof.*

On the way back from Goa on the highway, we were looking out for a place to have dinner. Nothing interesting seemed to come by and we were getting hungry. We decided to stop at the next *dhaba* we see **whether or not** we like it.

And stopped we did.

This was a sleepy Rajasthani dhaba with one table occupied in the corner (truck drivers I guessed without being too judgemental). I even hesitantly asked “khana milega kya” and the waiter non-chalantly nodded as if to say *“isn’t that what dhabas are for? fooood”.*

Now things started to get interesting. In the 25-odd minutes we took to order, eat and get out… the place came alive!

> We were one car. One car only, when we walked in.It was 7 cars in 25 minutes. Almost all tables full.

That’s the power of social proof. So next time if you’re starting a restaurant or cafe, **pay** your friends to sit and drink your coffee for a week or two. And ask them to act as if they’re having the time of their lives. :D And watch new customers come in.

Same goes with any other kind of business.
It’s not cheating. It’s just strategy. That’s how people work.
