## The mountain trail 1

This one is something I have a feeling is somewhere in Rishikesh. It was always there and we missed it. At the end of the tourist path begins a long long trail. There’s no elevation gain, but the ledge is too narrow to walk. You have to hang from the top ledge and move. And it’s a very very very long trail. Interestingly you can see all of it in one go. It’s a long curve. Gorgeous but scary. I don’t think I got to the end of it in any dreams.

## The mountain trail 2

This is a trail that leads to a place of certain importance. I do not know what kind of importance. Maybe something like Kedarnath. But more surreal. Like something more phenomenal and fundamental. This one is also a dangerous trail. The ledges become very narrow and on every curve I’m afraid I’ll slip and fall. But I usually don’t remember ever turning back because of the danger. But this trail too, I never complete. For practical reasons. I never seem to have the time. So I only walk so far and turn back to reach the starting point. But I meet people on this trail. Singular, not plural. I can see signs of civilization(now deserted) but I only meet ‘persons’. They look very ugly and horrific. But I don’t think I’ve been afraid of them or detest them. Probably because I explain to myself that their condition is a consequence of the place they have been in. Infact I end up pitying them for the extremities they face.

## The extraordinary jungle

A place I’ve only ended up once. But what an extraordinary jungle. The most majestic of all the places maybe. And the first thing on my mind was “I need to get everyone here!”. Waterfalls, creepers, hills and woods of unspoken beauty. This truly was a mystical place. So that’s the catch. This place always felt like ‘*too good to be true*’. The reason why I said I’ve been there once is because I’ve searched actively in my dreams to find it again and never did. It’s funny. My dream world knows that a certain trail led to it and that it was unbelievable but I can’t find my way back to it.

## The deep cave

The cave, I remember the least details of. But it was a deep one. Deep enough that it sends a shiver down my spine as I write this. And narrow. Strangely, I think I’ve been to the end of it. And even though I’ve arrived at the cave’s mouth more than once in different dreams, I chose to not go down the hole again. I’m not sure if I was afraid from the thought of the effort or the thought of the fright it causes.

In all these places, there are some common themes. I’ve always walked alone. And never met anyone on the way(except trail 2). And in almost all the places, I’ve gasped “I’ve got to get my best friends to see this”.
