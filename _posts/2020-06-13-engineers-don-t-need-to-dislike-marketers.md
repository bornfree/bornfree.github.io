**Stochastic**

> having a random probability distribution or pattern that may be analysed statistically but may not be predicted precisely.

**Deterministic**

> model, procedure, process, etc., whose resulting behavior is entirely determined by its initial state and inputs, and which is not random or stochastic

Computer Programming is very deterministic. And the results are instant. Whether right or wrong. That is not to say it is easy.

But computer programmers often take a position that other roles are not as challenging or hard as programming is. Say marketing for example. This isn’t true.

They are hard too. But the results are neither easy to measure nor instant.

BTW all processes in universe are stochastic. When you build finite models in the universe, you make it more deterministic.

A program that adds two numbers is absolutely deterministic you may say. But think again. If these numbers were big enough, the chances of [cosmic rays flipping a certain bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_error#Cosmic_rays_creating_energetic_neutrons_and_protons) would be high enough that the program may indeed go wrong every time you add 2 massive numbers. Poof!

So why is computer programming more deterministic than marketing?
Because humans invented the model called computer. It has all the components *we* created ourselves. Whose behavior is known and understood at a very high precision and probability.
![Things on the left are surprisingly well-understood than things on the right](https://via.placeholder.com/600x300/cccccc/666666?text=Chip+vs+People)
Whereas something like marketing operates in a different model that deals with components called humans, among other things. These things are not understood at the same degree MOSFETs or operating system kernels are understood. Even worse, they behave differently in every iteration.

In general, the world of machines is more deterministic than the natural world. Simply because we invented those worlds. Until we fully understand the worlds not invented by us, we must stay humble and curious.
