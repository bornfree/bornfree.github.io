Because I want to frame thoughts before committing.

Because I want to measure in imagination, how it will be received.

Because I fear being judged.

Because I want to arrive at a comfortable time and composure.

Because I'm lazy.

Excuses. All of them.

I don't need anybody's permission. I shouldn't care about the reception. This is my small place in the world. And I will do as I please. Beautiful, ugly, bizarre and serene.
