It feels like I’m back in time. To the same point I was a few years. 
Head in my arms. Clueless and confused. Alone.

I’m not sure why I keep coming back to this. Uncertainty. A job, salary, car all seemed good. But no, you wanted to be a *superman*. A *nut-job*.

Now you’re here again.
What the fuck.
