Don't we?

If I asked you to imagine

> A young girl who is snatched away from her family, sold to somebody else, sold again, sexually exploited, tasked with chores of cooking and cleaning every single day, made to bear children, possibly multiple times, possibly without a choice, restricted to a small place, abused verbally and physically and when she is old and useless, abandoned and forgotten. 

Everybody would be horrified. Wouldn't we?

We did all of this in the past. To women.
We do all of this today. To animals.

If you replace the **young woman **with achicken, a cow, a goat, a pig, a lamb the narrative becomes the reality of the modern world.
Go ahead, just try reading it once again.

When I look at animals today, domesticated or wild, I feel sad. Sometimes so sad that I can feel a lump in my throat. What a tragedy it is that we have reduced so many animals capable of intelligence and independent living to mere resources.

How should I feel?
Happy for the women or sad for the animals?

But bear in mind that women's situation improved with time.
Animals' got worse.
