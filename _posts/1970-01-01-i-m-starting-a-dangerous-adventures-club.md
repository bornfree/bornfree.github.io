Do we need another one? Yes. Because the *dangerous* one that I want doesn’t seem to exist around here. Over time, I’ve realized that I indeed have an affinity for the perilous and uncertain. An affinity hard to ignore.

> Some people are most alive when they’re almost not. 

Sitting mostly in a group of people who do not understand that, even worse mock it, runs the risk of feeling that you’re wrong. I’ve been called a *monkey*, *psycho* and even a *masochist* so far! :D 

Now I’m setting out to find the people who think otherwise. People that scare me to do things. Things I myself would shudder to do.

Let me give you an example by what I mean when I say *not dangerous*

This is me skydiving in Langkawi from~10000ft

There is a tandem diver on your back who’s dived more than 500 times.

Percentage of risk is close to zero.

This is adrenaline rush.

This is **not danger.**

Tell me when you’ve solo skydived. I’ll bite that. That’s real adventure.

Real adventure probably starts when…

- You are wading water deep inside a dark cave and you feel the oxygen is thinning. The nearest exit is 1.5 km away.
- You are halfway across a highline between two cliffs and its starts blowing violently. Turning back is an option you don’t have.
- You are diving 100ft underwater in the middle of the ocean. You came to see dolphins. Now there is a shark in the waters.
