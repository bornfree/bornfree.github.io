Few teachers are stickler to basics. When asked to teach their subject, they start with a particular emphasis on *the basics*.

But nobody is here to learn the intricate fundamentals of a discipline the very first time. Hell, you don't know if they will even like it. 

Let me take 3 things I dabble around in. Code, guitar and diving.

If before I teach someone the first line of code, I bore them with concepts of source and machine code, memory management, time complexity... they'd simply doze off.

If before I let someone play their first tune, I go down the route of chords, octaves and scales... they'd probaby think guitar is a very boring activity.

Same with diving. Nobody is ever going to come back if you teach them decompression before they even touch water.

Let them have **fun** first.
Be amazed by printing a silly word on the screen.
Revel in the joy of playing a popular tune.
Get excited by making bubbles while breathing underwater.

They'll learn the basics anyway if they like it.
