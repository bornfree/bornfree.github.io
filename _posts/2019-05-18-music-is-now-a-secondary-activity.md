Nobody just listens to music anymore.
Think about it for a second.

Nobody *just* listens to music anymore.
Think about it for a second.

What I mean by *‘just’ *is, doing that activity and that activity alone.

Sure we are listening to music all the time. 
While driving, commuting, studying, drinking, dancing… it’s a secondary activity that makes a lot of other activities either pleasurable or bearable. But it’s rarely the main activity.

Remember the times when *just* listening was a thing? 
The days when Walkmans and Discmans were your*** my precious***.

We used to literally sit down by the window, close our eyes and *just* listen to music.

In the 70s, maybe friends used to invite friends over so that they can all sit together in a room and *just* listen to music on the gramophone.

In the present day, the situations when people are *just* listening to music is probably only at events and concerts.

> In all others, music is simply a secondary activity.
