It didn’t occur to me until my colleague pointed it out. There is a big company that went multilingual with their website but failed to the bare minimum to point out to their users that they have.

Tucked away in the corner was this small menu that sheepishly read *Languages.*

Even after you finally select a language, most of the content is still in English. Blah! That’s like serving *chicken biryani* to a vegetarian and asking him to pick the vegetables and eat, if any.

Truth is, I can’t blame them. I can’t blame most of the companies that localize their product and services because nobody around knows any better on how to do it. This section of the Indian internet isn’t even birthed. Let alone being perfected.

We’ve got miles to go!
