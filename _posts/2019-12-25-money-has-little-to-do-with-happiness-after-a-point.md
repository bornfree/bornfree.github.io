There is a point when money stops buying happiness. It can happen at different points for different people. But I think it happens to all of us. Some of us notice it, some of us don’t.

One way to notice it is to see how many things we buy. And how quickly the the happiness comes and goes.

Interestingly, this isn’t even a fancy philosophy. It is backed by actual data and research.

Once your basic needs are taken care of, most of the things that give you happiness in life *really* are free. I particularly like the 1,2 and 3 he calls out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNzLkdr7UIU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2795). Both true and funny.

Sunsets, silence, friends… the taste of water, a hug from a loved one, a good night’s sleep. And most importantly, *time*. — These are few among many things we can’t buy.
Time to read.
Time to walk.
Time to play with your kids or pets.
Time for your hobby.
Time to simply notice the passage of time.

I’ve had my rough patch with money. Now I’m in a more comfortable situation. So it is easy to misconstrue what I’m saying.

I’m not saying money is evil. Money is absolutely essential for food, shelter, clothing and health. And a really good ice cream!

I’m also am not saying that anyone should not aim for making money.

All I’m saying is, don’t be surprised when you make the money you wanted and don’t find a lot of happiness. It is not meant to be.
