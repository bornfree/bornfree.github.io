You're clever when you figure out something that is possible, but isn't and shouldn't really be the norm.

You're smart when you figure out something that people when they learn about it would say "damn, this is how we should all do it".

You're clever if you find a loophole in the law.
You're smart if you find cheaper air tickets on a different website.
