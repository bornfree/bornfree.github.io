Chandigarh is the modern Indian's sanctuary. 

To the extent I feel emotional about it.
I was neither born nor raised here. I've been here a mere 6 months.

Chandigarh truly epitomizes a modern Indian city. It's a matter of achievement that contemporary Indians would be proud of.

When you consider most Indian cities and whatever they're usually famous for, it is always some version of historic significance. A certain kingdom, a certain architecture, a certain culture etc.

This has the effect of making of us believe that India's best days were in the past.

But if you're like me, future-facing than past-facing, you'll love Chandigarh. Chandigarh serves as proof of what modern Indians can do when they put their best foot forward and act courageously.

Infrastructure (roads, sectors, parks, lake, hospitals)
Law & order (rules, challans, no-hawkers, safety)
Lifestyle (food, shopping, events, hobbies)
