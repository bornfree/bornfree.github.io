Books improve thinking in a way that movies can't.

One of my hypothesis is simply that a book is a product of one person's thinking only. Unadulterated by opinions or perspectives of a hundred others. Movies unfortunately end up being the average of everybody's inputs.

The second argument is that reading a book is like undertaking a *long* journey into one person's mind. The emphasis on long being intentional. Given the amount of modern distractions, just reading a book with focus is probably equivalent to meditating.

Put together, a sustained focus on a distilled topic is a powerful way to train one's mind.

Hmm. That reminds me that I should read more.
