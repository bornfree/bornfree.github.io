It's been roughly 4 months since we moved to Chandigarh. We still get asked the question:

> Why are you even in Chandigarh?

People find it strange because our offices are not in Chandigarh, nor do we have family or too many friends here.

But in our heads fortunately, we had clarity. After Covid forced WFH on everyone, we realized we could stay *anywhere*. We didn't have immovable assets or kids (thank god!). 

So we started researching. Our factors were:

- Tier-2 city. We were bored of Bangalore, Hyderabad and Delhi.
- Proximity to places of interest/travel and in particular mountains.
- A generally great place to live.

Only** Pune** and **Chandigarh** checked off all these points. We chose Chandigarh to try living in the north for a while.

I don't intend to make this a post about must-see-places of the city. Google and a dozen other listicle platforms do a far better job.

This post, is a very personal journal of our stay here. About parks, evening walks, traffic fines, milkmen, rents, street dogs, summer heat and a dozen other things that you'd only get to know if you stayed long enough to let city's character seep into you.

Maybe it's a little old-fashioned to write a blog post than do Insta stories. But this is too close to our hearts
