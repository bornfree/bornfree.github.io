I ended up conceptualizing a framework while evaluating the market opportunity for my own startup, [ImageTranslate](https://www.imagetranslate.com).

It ended up being quite insightful that I thought I should share it with more people.

HMHO stands for ***How Many & How Often***. Nothing fancy. ðŸ˜„
What it means is â€˜how many people can possibly use this productâ€™ and â€˜how often are they going toâ€™.

## Ready for the basicÂ plots?

Now letâ€™s put some example markets on this graph to give it more meaning.
![](/assets/images/HMHO--A-framework-for-looking-at-startups/1-hNGgLuhDZ1yjaj0jIuawpA.png)An example for eachÂ quadrant
**Food**
Every single person on the planet needs it, and needs it 3 times a day.

**Travel**
Lot of people travel. But not all. And they donâ€™t travel as often.

**Point-of-Sale**
Merchants use PoS. Theyâ€™re not too many of them. But its their everyday tool.

**Architecture**
A small set of humans avail this. Even they probably do so only once in a lifetime.

## Plotting startups. The funÂ begins!

Now that weâ€™ve plotted sample markets, letâ€™s plot startups. Iâ€™m primarily going to deal with Indian startups because I understand them better. Or letâ€™s say I use their products and service more than the non-Indian startups.
![](/assets/images/HMHO--A-framework-for-looking-at-startups/1-i2Z0me3Kfs-IEgKz2cZF0w.png)Thatâ€™s a lot to takeÂ in!
I know itâ€™s overwhelming and we havenâ€™t covered even 25% of the popular startups. There is no particular reason to choose only these startups. Theyâ€™re just representative of the position and market they operate in.

Now letâ€™s add ***time*** to the mix!
![](/assets/images/HMHO--A-framework-for-looking-at-startups/1-4OBkatZuUNPYvJHCZf1S1Q.png)Segmented by frequency. Frequency indicates how often a user interacts with a product/service.
You should understand this graph slowly going over each company.Â 
No ***really***. Spend a minute and then weâ€™ll dive into it.

## Category one
![](/assets/images/HMHO--A-framework-for-looking-at-startups/1-hQglZG_6z-5hbSORs2kXIA.png)
- News and media demand attention of *every* kind of people. *Every hour*. No wonder the most valuable startup in the world is then [ByteDance and not Uber.](https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/26/chinas-bytedance-leapfrogs-uber-to-becomes-worlds-most-valuable-startup/)
- Paytm, the new darling of Indian startup scene (older being Flipkart)is rightly placed so. Top-goddamn-right. Earlier most new entrants wanted to do E-com. Now everyone wants to do FinTech.
- Food is a sector that wonâ€™t be exhausted anytime soon. And Swiggy and Zomato donâ€™t have plans to stop till the end of Y-axis is reached.
- Thereâ€™s nothing much to add about Ola besides the perennial tug-of-war with Uber.
- Hotstar is doing quite impressive. The only problem here is that there is too much competition now.
- Byjuâ€™s, a startup with customer segment as students ending up in the unicorn space?! Maybe that talks of our Indian obsession with education. Meh.

## Category Two
![](/assets/images/HMHO--A-framework-for-looking-at-startups/1-50h8bIWvYD28sN1Xj5-09A.png)
- Thereâ€™s nothing glorious about eggs, toothpaste and shampoo but but you need them every week. BigBasket of course doesnâ€™t have a user-base bigger than Flipkartâ€™s but if they play long enough, they will. Also, why do you think Flipkart is that keen on [grocery](https://www.flipkart.com/grocery-supermart-store?marketplace=GROCERY)?
- Flipkart is doing good. Except that a foreign player, Amazon, entered this plot with too many resources. Their stand is still *very* admirable.
- Dream11 basically hit a sixer on the ball called *Indiansâ€™ fanaticism with cricket*. Cricbuzz and Cricinfo were always there. But I guess they didnâ€™t want to venture into the grey areas.
- Dunzo is something small with a chance to make it obscenely big. Getting things from point A to point B *will* disrupt multiple markets. Just wait and watch.
- Vogo is Zoomcar for bikes. Right now delivery guys like it. Eventually lot of others will.

## Category 3
![](/assets/images/HMHO--A-framework-for-looking-at-startups/1-Wl8wUj-4D1gOIccn2nKtbA.png)
- Every single human falls ill at some point of time or other. When they do, they no longer think of their doctor. They think of Practo. Thatâ€™s something!
- MMT, BMS, RedBus and OYO all deal with travel. But this space has natural limits for an ambitious company. Not all people travel and not that often.
OYO is eyeing co-working and co-living spaces. Both bigger markets with higher frequency.
- Zoomcar is the pioneer that spawned 20 other companies. Brave. And a beautiful UI btw.
- Rentomojo and Nestaway are just 2 examples in the housing category. There are atleast 10 similar competitors. This is the SaaS subscription equivalent for B2C. Sweet!
- Cred is this fancy thing from Kunal Shah for paying CC bills. The app is slick. But I am wondering how big the market is to justify a [$100mn investment.](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/kunal-shahs-cred-in-talks-for-100-million-from-hillhouse-others/articleshow/68881434.cms)

## Category 4
![](/assets/images/HMHO--A-framework-for-looking-at-startups/1-_o6688SlkCTTMcs0XQeGDQ.png)
- Taxes and insurance are once-in-a-year-thing. But damn. Almost everyone *has* to do them whether or not they like them. ClearTax and CoverFox atleast make it painless.
- Furniture is also a one year to two year thing. Urban Ladder prices everything obscenely high and still seems to be going strong. I really am wishing for *Indian Ikea* that delivers to home.
- Explara is one example for all ticketing startups. The market is very limited and diverse at the same time. Not an easy place to operate.

## Category 5
![](/assets/images/HMHO--A-framework-for-looking-at-startups/1-k9dSY4uwd7oQrOt8le-U7w.png)
- What are things people do every few years?
Change jobs, buy vehicles, move houses. Obvious once you see it.

There are a *lot *of new ideas here.

- People buy homes once in multiple decades maybe. But the margins on each transaction can be in lakhs. Selling matters more than anything for somebody like MagicBricks.
- VakilSearch basically made a service look like a product. But legal and paperwork in India is a pain. So unless someone challenges them in this space, theyâ€™re here to stay.
- Shaadi and Lifecell are just out here as anchors. Almost everyone gets married *once in a lifetime*. Almost no-one(0.1% of rich) affords stem cells storage* once in a lifetime*.

## Full perspective

Letâ€™s repeat the image again. To see everything in perspective.
![](/assets/images/HMHO--A-framework-for-looking-at-startups/1-4OBkatZuUNPYvJHCZf1S1Q.png)Thereâ€™s no right or wrong place to be in thisÂ plot
I know, not everyone agrees with this framework. And thatâ€™s ok.
Remember:

> *All models are wrong, but some are useful*

You will discover the usefulness of this as we explore more in subsequent posts.

In the next post, weâ€™ll identify what each of these quadrants signify and about the DNAs of the startups in them.
