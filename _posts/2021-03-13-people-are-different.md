In a recent conversation, I realized I lacked clarity in my head about something.

India renamed the city of Allahabad to Prayagraj in 2018. Allahabad was the name given during Mughal era and a typically Islamic one. Prayagraj is a Hindu name and Yogi Adityanath who initated this change has a well-known agenda.

To be honest, I cringed at this. 
1. Renaming of places is a wasteful affair of time, money and other resources.
2. It's a subtle way of alienating the minorities that inhabit the place.

But what is less known is that India also renamed the islands of Andamans in 2018. Havelock and Neil became Swaraj Dweep and Shaheed Dweep.
The former names were from British occupation and the latter given as a tribute to Netaji.

I was ok with this. In fact I was elated.
But I was also confused with myself.

In both cases, names given by oppressors and invaders have been replaced. How can I feel differently about both then?

Then I embarked on finding explanations.

**Time since**

The memory of British oppression is still very fresh in comparison to the Mughal invasions. 70 years versus 400 years. 

**Population size**

Muslim population in India in 200 million (15%). In comparison, Anglo-Indian population in Indian is a mere 1 million. The British never really integrated into the Indian society.

**Cultural influence**

British influenced our clothing: shirts and trousers. But Mughals influenced our language. Hindi borrows plentily from Arabic. Lot of Indian foods, Biryani and other meat dishes, are Islamic imports.

But this will change slowly in the future. 
In a century or two, we will be more forgiving of the Britishers too. The Independence struggle will not evoke the same patriotic fervour as it does today. Disliking the British might even be seen as intolerant!

I put this argument forth to the people who are very keen on alienating the Islamic population in the country. Be gentle with the current India. Uphold it's secular fabric. This land is home to both Hindus and Muslims. And many other faiths all of who who'd love to protect, serve and enjoy.
