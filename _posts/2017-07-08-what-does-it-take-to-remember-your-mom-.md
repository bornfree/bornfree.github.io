v+

Trying to climb knowing all at the same time that only fools climb without gear and only absolute fools climb with rucksacks on a 70 degree slope.

v=0

Shit! The casual exclamation when the first rock beneath your feet yields. This is regular stuff you think. While you involuntarily gain a hold with the other foot, it loses grip too.

v-

No! This is not normal. You never lost it twice. This situation is completely unwelcome. Every attempt to stop now is only going to be more difficult because you are speeding up.

v - -

Gravity is grinning. It got you, finally; after years. While you recklessly try to dig your fingers into the mountain slope trying to grab something,anything… you know it isn’t going to help. All you do is to keep your body sticking to the surface even though it’s hurting.

v — — -

Hope is lost. You wonder if it was supposed to end this way. You’re just anticipating the fall now, the immense pain and the everlasting peace that is to be delivered in a second.

**v = 0**

Stop. Miraculously. The bottles in your rucksack go tumbling down the 40ft fall that was waiting for you. It wasn’t supposed to happen but it did. A second chance. While the heaviness of that realisation dawns, your eyes are already moist. Mom. She’s the first one on your mind.
