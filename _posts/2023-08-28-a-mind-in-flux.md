It's hard to know when and how the mind finds something to latch on and starts weaving a magical string of thoughts and when it meanders endlessly unable to hold and entertain even one.

Like tonight. When I can't hold even these simple paragraphs in my head without tripping over 10 other things. 

It is probably just a reminder of how thin the line between chaos and order is. And order almost always is a negligent fraction of chaos. There are after all so many ways something could be chaotic than it could be ordered.
