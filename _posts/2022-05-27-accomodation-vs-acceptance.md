You might say that's something so universally known that it hardly needs more words on the subject.

Universally known, true, but applied when needed? Maybe not.

Because in our everyday interactions with others, whenever we find ourselves in disagreement and conflict, we don't seem to apply it as much. How often have we tried to understand *why* our colleague is making a certain point and not just *what* she is making? 

Of late, I've been finding myself a little more accommodative of the thoughts of people which I previously couldn't withstand. Right-wingers, fervent nationalists, chauvinists, religious folk etc. 
*Accommodative*, not necessarily *accepting*. That difference is important.
