The rage is all about AI assistants. Assistants that can write code, do market research, create slides for you, or make a marketing plan. Hell, even make you a meal plan. Anything that basically an assistant would do for you.

And then I wonder, why not set aside the hubris? If the current breed of LLMs and AI are actually very intelligent, much, much more intelligent than the 95th percentile human being, why have them be an assistant at all? Why not let them be the boss? Why can't we actually let the AI know the outcome that we want, and then let it take the boss role?

It perhaps sounds ridiculous and funny, but I am actually serious. Why not have an AI that actually is a boss and has a human assistant who is capable of doing many things and has a particular set of skills? Given a goal and an outcome to drive towards, the AI is actually going to set the plan for the human assistant, which is you, for a day, for a week, for the whole year maybe.
