Note to self:

> Self discipline takes you farther than impulses

Simply because impulses are by definition very short-term. 
And because anything ambitious, large, complex and world-changing requires time and patience, discipline is the only solution.

Even if you didn't want to do anything of that sort and enjoy unlimited freedom, just slacking off has a massive side-effect of brain and body rot. 

So to put it in other words:

> Self discipline is the price to pay for personal freedom
